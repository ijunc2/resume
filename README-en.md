#### 내용
_Back-end Programmer and Dev-ops_
* Developed the back-end server using the Java Spring framework 3. 
* Constructed the model of the database of our service using the normalization of the database.
* Test-driven development with Spock
* Improved the back-end server to be asyncronized in Spring 4. It made the service more efficient by using less the thread of the servlet and made the code less complex using chaining programming(FR)
* Packed the common codes which are technically like more cored in order to help co-workers develop the product more easily and concentrate on the only business logic. 
* For searching and recommending system, built up the system which consists of a NoSQL named Elasticsearch. It helped us analyze the data, and this log data was used to understand user preference.
* Developed the payment system and the framework using the third-party system. The most important thing is to construct the system of the payment, and the next is to pack the code with the common part. This will help co-workers to concentrate on the business logic.
* The systems and algorithms I mentioned above were built in AWS. And the servers were made using load-balancing and auto-scaling etc for high availability.
* Built up the building system which was combined with the Jenkins and the Github. It saved a lot of time for building the system using just one click.
* Developed the web service to manage the service. The functions include to deal with the service data and some other stuff. This admin site was used to the authorization system to access the page depending on the users who are employees having the correct authorization. Developed the system to check out the statistic data for the service which was developed with Elasticsearch.

_Android Programmer_
* Developed the front-end framework using Android SDK for being more comfortable according to the OOP and the design pattern, and some of them consisted of RxJava(Reactive-Stream). 
* Integrated with the API from the back-end server using a custom Retrofit framework.
